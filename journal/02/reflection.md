# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

Holy cows and assorted saintly livestock. I've learned so much. I've had a javascript breakthrough by reading about the solid principles and now I understand what went wrong with my Moody Kittens project.  Those principles should be referenced earlier or at least linked to. It helps make sense of the other projects.

This changes everything.

And so does the lecture the next morning where Mick explained why alias variables can be either references or primitives. That's what I broke in my Moody Kittens moodiness variables and functions. That's why they worked and then they didn't.
