# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I am learning a lot and enjoy the CSS HTML stuff. I struggled with the kittens project, surprisingly failing the things that worked earlier in the week.  I wasn't sending it to GitHub so when I finally did it I didn't have those copies I hadn't messed up yet.  So I learned an expensive lesson about version control.

I'm mostly struggling with assignments that are more written than visual. The visual based lab today was extraordinarily fun and I really enjoyed it.  I had a hard time understanding exactly what was asked of me in the written kittens assignment and had to go back and look at other assignments to understand it.

My victory is that I'm hear and I'm learning. After my PhD program went under I thought I would never learn in a structured environment again.
