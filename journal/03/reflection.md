# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I hate English plurals and the letter s.

That's been all my mistakes this week so far. I think the reason I like this week so much is that I had to deal with similar concepts in my last job when I had to oversee our database migration and oversee our new inventory control procedures. It was a similar process of delegation by department and controlling their access to both see and change the data.

I actually don't feel like this week added much, but that's mostly because I understand the MVC concept and see that we're breaking the same types of code we've been writing up by duty and utilizing them in different pages/files/whatever. The abstraction has been helpful, I suppose, but I also look at those things and try to understand how they work generally because I am a nerd.
